## Description

This chatbot is a complete solution for those looking to create a feature-rich chatbot with user authentication and data storage capabilities. The chatbot uses [OpenAI's language model](https://openai.com/language-models/) to generate responses to user inputs and presents them in a sleek and intuitive interface built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and styled with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

User authentication is managed through [Google Sign-In](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in), allowing users to easily sign in to the chatbot using their existing Google account. The chatbot also integrates with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), a popular real-time database platform, to store and retrieve user data such as chat history and user preferences.
This chatbot is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a statically typed superset of JavaScript, providing improved type checking and code reliability.

By using Next.js, TailwindCSS, Firebase, Google Sign-In, and TypeScript, this chatbot offers a robust and scalable solution for those looking to create a feature-rich chatbot.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
